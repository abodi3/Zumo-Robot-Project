# Zumo robot project
## Embedded system development project

PSoC Creator project for Metropolia PSoC-Zumo adapter

Developers:
Cultural group members: Uyiosa, Zoltan and Albert

1st year students of Metropolia UAS in Espoo, Finland

Aim:
Control Zumo robot to:
* Follow a drawn path
* Simple sumo style match

Robot control include:
* Follow battery voltage level and notify user if recharge is timely
* Read and process sensor data
* Control motors to drive the robot (forward, backward, turn)
* Implement basic behavior
* ultrasonic sensor
* IR receiver
* reflectance sensors (6pcs)
* 1 button freely useable

Battery voltage level measurement:
The microcontroller operates with 5V, higher voltage would damage it.
Therefore actual battery voltage scaled down to 2/3.
Voltage directed to A/D converter. The code read from ADC and stored in `adcresult`.
Formula to calculate scaled down (0V - 5V) voltage: `V.inad = (adcresult / 4095) * 5V`
Finally to calculate actual voltage: `volts = volts * 1.5`
The safety level set in 4V. If voltage falls to 4V or below the blue LED turned on and the motors get disabled.
